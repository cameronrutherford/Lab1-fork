# CISC2200 Spring 2024 Lab1 - CAMERON

In this first lab assignment, we setup our **programming environment**, **modify given code**,
and **practice submitting to autograder system**.

## Programming Environment Setup

We will set up programming environment our our own computer, by following [Setup Tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/).

- The _Commannd Line Tools_ are required.

- The _C++ Dev Environment_ (VSCode) is highly recommened.

**Please follow these tutorials closely and carefully.**

- Follow the [VSCode Devcontainer Setup Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and run using Docker locally
- Launch this repo in a GitHub Codespace, and copy your file into the auto grader...

## Programming Requirement

A code skeleton is given for this lab. From your terminal (mac or WSL/Ubunto) window, you can use the following command to download it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CISC2200-Spring2024/lab1.git
```

You are asked to finish the following (i.e., the three Todo's in the IntArray.cpp), test and run the program:

1. Implement the IntArray class's constructor
